# 📄 AWS IAM – Interview Questions

Below are some commonly asked AWS IAM interview questions with simple and clear answers.

---

❓ Q: What is AWS IAM, and why is it important?

✅ A: AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that helps control who can access your AWS resources.  
It lets you manage users, groups, roles, and their permissions. IAM is crucial for:
- 🔒 Securing your AWS account
- ✅ Enforcing least privilege
- 🛡️ Ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions

❓ Q: What is the difference between IAM users and IAM roles?

👤 IAM User:
- A specific person or app with permanent access
- Has its own credentials (password/access key)
- Example: A developer logging into the AWS Console

🎭 IAM Role:
- Used for **temporary access**
- No long-term credentials
- Usually assumed by services (like EC2 accessing S3)
- Example: Lambda assuming a role to read from DynamoDB

❓ Q: What are IAM policies, and how do they work?

📜 IAM Policies:
- JSON documents that define **what actions are allowed or denied**
- Attached to: users, groups, or roles
- Example:
  - Allow `s3:GetObject` on a specific bucket
- How they work:
  - If an action is **allowed** in the policy → it's permitted
  - If not mentioned or explicitly **denied** → access is blocked

❓ Q: What is the principle of least privilege, and why is it important?

🔐 Principle of Least Privilege:
- Only give users the **minimum** permissions needed for their job
- Reduces the chance of:
  - 🚫 Unauthorized access
  - 💣 Accidental data leaks
  - 🔓 Misuse of services

✅ Helps keep your AWS environment secure and efficient.

❓ Q: What is an AWS managed policy?

🛠️ AWS Managed Policy:
- Predefined by AWS
- Covers common use cases (like `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`)
- Updated and maintained by AWS
- You can attach them directly to users, groups, or roles

📝 Example:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
