# 📄 AWS IAM – Interview Questions

Below are some frequently asked AWS IAM interview questions with simple and clear answers.

---

### ❓ Q1: What is AWS IAM, and why is it important?

✅ **A:** AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that lets you securely control access to AWS resources.

It's important because:

- 🔒 It secures your cloud environment  
- ✅ Enforces the principle of least privilege  
- 🛡️ Ensures only authorized users/services can perform actions

### ❓ Q2: What is the difference between IAM users and IAM roles?

**👤 IAM User:**

- Used for people or applications  
- Has permanent credentials (password or access key)  
- **Example:** Developer logging into AWS Console  

**🎭 IAM Role:**

- Used for temporary access  
- No long-term credentials  
- Can be assumed by trusted entities (e.g., EC2 accessing S3)  
- **Example:** Lambda function reading from DynamoDB

### ❓ Q3: What are IAM policies, and how do they work?

**📜 IAM Policies:**

- JSON documents defining permissions  
- Specify what actions are allowed or denied  
- Attached to users, groups, or roles  

✅ **How it works:**

- If action is listed as `"Allow"` → access granted  
- If action is `"Deny"` or not present → access denied  

📝 **Example:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}

❓ Q4: What is the principle of least privilege, and why is it important?

🔐 Principle of Least Privilege:
- Give users ONLY the permissions they need
- Avoids over-permissioning
- Protects against:
  - 🚫 Unauthorized access
  - 💣 Accidental or malicious changes
  - 🔓 Security breaches

❓ Q5: What is an AWS managed policy?

🛠️ AWS Managed Policy:
- Predefined by AWS
- Covers common use cases (e.g., AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess)
- Maintained and updated by AWS
- Easy to attach to users, groups, or roles

---

📌 Pro Tips:
- Always enable MFA for users, especially root
- Avoid using the root account for everyday tasks
- Regularly audit and review IAM permissions
