# 📅 Day 1 - Introduction to Cloud Computing

## 💭 Imagine This First:
Before cloud computing, companies had to buy physical servers, store them in data centers, and manage electricity, cooling, and maintenance. It was expensive and required a lot of effort.

## ☁️ What is Cloud Computing? 
"Using someone else’s powerful computers (called servers) over the internet to store, manage, and process data, instead of doing it on your own local machines."

☁️ 1. Public Cloud
🔹 Definition:
A public cloud is a cloud environment shared by many users, provided over the internet by third-party companies like:

AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Microsoft Azure

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

You rent cloud services like servers, storage, etc., and the cloud provider manages everything — you just use it.

🔑 Key Features:
Shared infrastructure (multiple customers use same servers, securely separated)

No hardware to manage

Very cost-effective

Scales easily (add more resources anytime)

Accessible from anywhere

✅ Real-Life Example:
Using Google Drive or AWS EC2 — you don’t own the server, but you can use it via the internet.

👨‍💻 Use Case:
Startups, web applications, testing environments, etc.

🏢 2. Private Cloud
🔹 Definition:
A private cloud is a cloud environment used by one organization only. It gives more control, security, and customization.

It can be:

Hosted on-premises (in the company’s own data center)

Or hosted by a third-party, but dedicated to one single customer

Only your company uses the resources — no sharing with others.

🔑 Key Features:
High security and privacy

Fully customizable

More expensive

Requires more IT management

✅ Real-Life Example:
A bank hosting its customer data in its own secured private servers.

👨‍💻 Use Case:
Large enterprises, government agencies, healthcare, or financial companies needing full control.

🌥️ What is Hybrid Cloud?
Hybrid cloud is a combination of both public cloud and private cloud working together.

It allows organizations to:

Keep some resources in their private cloud (for sensitive data),

And use public cloud for other tasks like hosting a website, backups, or scaling quickly.

🔧 Simple Example:
Imagine a bank:

They store customer data (like account info) on their private cloud for high security.

But they run their website and handle peak traffic using AWS (public cloud).

So they are using both — that’s hybrid cloud.
