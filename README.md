# AWS Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal AWS learning journey!  
Here I document everything I learn about AWS â€” from basic services to advanced deployments using CloudFormation, Terraform, and more.

# ðŸš€ 30 Days of AWS Learning Journey

Welcome to our **30-Day AWS Learning Journey**! This repository documents our hands-on learning and project experience with various AWS services, tools, and concepts. The goal is to build a strong foundational understanding of AWS for cloud, DevOps, and infrastructure automation.

## ðŸ“… Day-wise Breakdown

### âœ… Day 1: Introduction to AWS
We explored the differences between private and public clouds, the advantages of moving to the cloud, and why organizations are adopting public cloud solutions. We were introduced to AWS core services and how they align with DevOps practices. Finally, we created our AWS account and navigated the AWS Management Console.

### âœ… Day 2: IAM (Identity and Access Management)
We learned how to manage user access in AWS through IAM. This included creating users, groups, and roles, assigning permissions using policies, and understanding best security practices.

### âœ… Day 3: EC2 Instances
We launched our first EC2 instance, connected via SSH, and learned about instance types, security groups, key pairs, and how EC2 fits into cloud architecture.

> **Project:** Deploy a simple web application (like Jenkins) on an EC2 instance and access it publicly.

### âœ… Day 4: AWS Networking (VPC)
We built a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and configured subnets, route tables, and gateways. This laid the foundation for designing secure and scalable network architectures on AWS.

### âœ… Day 5: AWS Security
We focused on securing our cloud infrastructure. Topics included configuring security groups, NACLs (Network ACLs), IAM policies, and implementing least-privilege access.

### âœ… Day 6: AWS Route 53
> **Project:** Register and configure a domain using Route 53, set up DNS records, and explore routing policies and health checks.

### âœ… Day 7: Secure VPC Setup with EC2 Instances
> **Project Highlights:**
- Create a VPC with public and private subnets
- Configure route tables, internet/NAT gateways
- Launch EC2 instances in each subnet
- Apply IAM roles, NACLs, and security groups
- Verify secure access and subnet routing

### âœ… Day 8: AWS Interview Questions
We prepared for interviews by reviewing EC2, IAM, and VPC-related questions.

### âœ… Day 9: Amazon S3
We explored object storage using Amazon S3. We created buckets, managed permissions, enabled versioning, and applied lifecycle rules.

### âœ… Day 10: AWS CLI
We practiced managing AWS services from the command line using AWS CLI, including EC2, S3, and IAM commands.

### âœ… Day 11: AWS CloudFormation
We learned Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using CloudFormation and created reusable templates.

> **Project:** Provision a complete app stack (EC2, networking, and security groups) using a CloudFormation template.

### âœ… Day 12: AWS CodeCommit
> **Project:** Create a private Git repository using CodeCommit, manage access policies, and collaborate using version control workflows.

### âœ… Day 13: AWS CodePipeline
> **Project:** Set up an automated CI/CD pipeline including source, build, and deployment stages.

### âœ… Day 14: AWS CodeBuild
> **Project:** Configure CodeBuild to compile and test code with a `buildspec.yml` file and integrate it into a CI/CD pipeline.

### âœ… Day 15: AWS CodeDeploy
> **Project:** Implement a Blue/Green deployment strategy using CodeDeploy for a zero-downtime deployment.

### âœ… Day 16: AWS CloudWatch
> **Project:** Set up custom CloudWatch alarms and metrics to monitor infrastructure and trigger alerts.

### âœ… Day 17: AWS Lambda
We created event-driven serverless functions and explored triggers and integrations with other AWS services.

### âœ… Day 18: CloudWatch Events and EventBridge
> **Project:** Build a serverless event-driven workflow that integrates multiple AWS services using EventBridge.

### âœ… Day 19: AWS CloudFront
> **Project:** Host a static website using S3 and serve it globally via CloudFront CDN.

### âœ… Day 20: AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
> **Project:** Build Docker images, push them to ECR, and use them in ECS/EKS workflows.

### âœ… Day 21: AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
> **Project:** Deploy and scale a multi-container application using ECS with service discovery and auto-scaling.

### âœ… Day 22: AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
> **Project:** Deploy a Kubernetes-based application using manifests on a fully managed EKS cluster.

### âœ… Day 23: AWS Secrets Manager
> **Project:** Securely store and rotate sensitive credentials like DB passwords or API keys.

### âœ… Day 24: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform
> **Project:** Use Terraform to provision a VPC, deploy applications in different availability zones, and set up a load balancer.

### âœ… Day 25: AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config
> **Project:** Enable CloudTrail to audit AWS API calls and set up AWS Config rules to ensure compliance.

### âœ… Day 26: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
> **Project:** Deploy an application behind a load balancer and monitor request distribution across targets.

### âœ… Day 27: Interview Questions & Cloud Migration
Reviewed 500+ AWS interview questions and explored cloud migration strategies and tools (Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, etc.).

### âœ… Day 28: AWS Migration Tools
We explored AWS Migration Hub, Server Migration Service (SMS), and Database Migration Service (DMS) and applied use cases for real-world cloud migrations.

### âœ… Day 29: AWS Best Practices
We reviewed AWS architecture best practices, focusing on:
- Cost optimization
- Security
- Performance
- High availability

### âœ… Day 30: Final Project with RDS
> **Project:** Deploy an application using EC2, VPC, Load Balancer, and connect it to a managed RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) instance.
